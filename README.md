Making bots to beat connect four.

Constraints:
* Bots should respond in < 10 seconds.
* Any techniques used should be easily generalizable to different board sizes (no opening/endgame tables)
* The bot CAN change strategies depending on the state of the game (ex. switch from minimax to some other algorithm depending on number of moves)
* Variants on minimax or completely different algorithms ARE allowed.
